The game 's main theme was how the characters regained their sense of self when stripped of their names and identities , along with general themes focused on war and its consequences . While making the anime , the production team were told by Sega to make it as realistic as possible , with the consequence that the team did extensive research into aspects such as what happened when vehicles like tanks were overturned or damaged . Due to it being along the same timeline as the original game and its television anime adaptation , the cast of Valkyria Chronicles could make appearances , which pleased the team . The opening theme , \" Akari ( Light ) <unk> \" ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , was sung by Japanese singer <unk> . The ending theme , \" Someday the Flowers of Light Will Bloom \" ( <unk> , Itsuka Saku Hikari no Hana ) , was sung by Minami Kuribayashi .
