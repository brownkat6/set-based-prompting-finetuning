The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolomé de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. \\'All the peoples of the world are humans,\\' Las Casas wrote, and \\'all the races of humankind are one.\\' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation \\'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.\\'\"\\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,” 2003\\nWhich one of the following statements about the Spanish conquest of the Americas is most accurate?<|start_2d|>\"African slavery was a direct result of Spanish settlements in Florida.\" <|split_2d|>\"Early native civilizations in Mexico introduced Spanish explorers to cattle ranching and wheat cultivation.\" <|split_2d|>\"Christopher Columbus was not the first European to have explored North America.\" <|split_2d|>\"Due to racial prejudice, Spanish explorers shunned intermarriage with native people.\" <|end_2d|>Answer: ',\n",
       " 'This question refers to the following information.\\n\"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\\nThe type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to what Southern Renaissance movement?<|start_2d|>\"Neoplatonism\" <|split_2d|>\"Antitrinitarianism\" <|split_2d|>\"Pietism\" <|split_2d|>\"Rationalism\" <|end_2d|>Answer: ',\n",
       " 'This question refers to the following information.\\nFirst we must remark that the cosmos is spherical in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. …\\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. …\\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. … The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. … Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\\nFrom the passage, one could argue that Copernicus was working in<|start_2d|>\"the Aristotelian tradition\" <|split_2d|>\"the natural magic tradition\" <|split_2d|>\"the skeptical tradition\" <|split_2d|>\"the Platonic/Pythagorean tradition\" <|end_2d|>Answer: ']"

Two people were rescued from the river; one had no injuries, while the other was transported to a hospital in critical condition. Six members of a maintenance crew working on the roadway were reported missing; three bodies were recovered, and the other three are presumed dead.[1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "The collapse blocked most shipping to and from the Port of Baltimore. Maryland Governor Wes Moore called the event a \"global crisis\" that had affected more than 8,000 jobs. The economic impact of the waterway's closure has been estimated at $15 million per day.\n",
    "Background\n",
    "Main articles: Francis Scott Key Bridge (Baltimore) and MV Dali\n",
    "Dali's size, though considered large, is less than that of the largest container ship.[3] It is recognized that bigger ships can cause bigger disasters, such as the 1,300-foot vessel in the 2021 Suez Canal obstruction.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Francis Scott Key Bridge was a steel arch-shaped continuous truss bridge, the second-longest in the United States and third-longest in the world.[4] Opened in 1977, the 1.6-mile (2.6 km; 1.4 nmi) bridge ran northeast from Hawkins Point, Baltimore, to Sollers Point in Dundalk in Baltimore County, Maryland. Before being damaged, it carried Interstate 695, a beltway around Baltimore;[5] its four lanes (two in each direction[6]) were used by some 34,000 vehicles each day, including 3,000 trucks, many of which hauled hazardous materials barred from the two harbor tunnels.[7][8]\n",
    "\n",
    "The bridge crossed one of the busiest shipping routes in the United States: the lower Patapsco River, which connects the Port of Baltimore to the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.[5][7] In 2023, the port handled more than 444,000 passengers and 52.3 million tons of foreign cargo valued at $80 billion.[5] It was the second-largest U.S. port for coal, and had been the leading port for automobiles and light trucks for 13 straight years, handling more than 847,000 vehicles in 2023.[9][10] It employed 15,000 people and indirectly supported 140,000 others,[11] annually helping to generate $3.3 billion in wages and salaries, $2.6 billion in business revenue, and $400 million in state and local tax revenue.[8]\n",
    "\n",
    "MV Dali is a container ship registered in Singapore, and at the time of the allision[a] was operated by Synergy Marine Group[12] and owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd,[13] both based in Singapore. A Neopanamax vessel completed in 2015, Dali has a length of 980 feet (300 m), a 157-foot (48 m) beam, and a 40-foot (12.2 m) draft.[14] Danish shipping company Maersk chartered Dali upon its delivery.[15] Once in service, Dali had undergone 27 inspections at ports globally,[16][17] including two in 2023: one in June in San Antonio, Chile, where a fuel-pressure gauge was repaired; and the second in September by the U.S. Coast Guard in New York, which found no problems.[18][19][17]\n",
    "\n",
    "In March 2024, Dali was crewed by 20 Indian nationals and one Sri Lankan.[20] The ship traveled from Panama to New York, arriving on March 19,[21] then sailed to the Virginia International Gateway in Portsmouth, Virginia.[22] The ship left Virginia on March 22 and the following day arrived in Baltimore,[23] where it underwent engine maintenance.[24][25]\n",
    "\n",
    "When the bridge was completed in 1977, the largest container ships could hold 2,000 to 3,000 twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) containers.[26] After the Panama Canal expansion began to allow the passage of 14,000-TEU vessels in 2016, the Maryland Port Administration installed new cranes and dredged the harbor to enable the port to accommodate the larger ships.[27] At the time of its collision, Dali was loaded nearly to its 10,000-TEU capacity with 4,700 forty-foot containers.[26]\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1980, a ship roughly one-third the size of Dali struck and lightly damaged one of the bridge's piers.[28][29] After the bridge collapsed in 2024, anonymous former agency officials told The Washington Post that the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) did not consider studying the possibility of a collision with a larger ship, and instead spent decades studying how terrorists might attack the bridge after the September 11 attacks or inspecting for structural flaws similar to those that caused the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse in 2007.[30]\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal regulations for protecting bridges from ship collisions were updated in 1991 after the Sunshine Skyway Bridge collapse in 1980, but existing bridges were exempted by a grandfather clause, and the Francis Scott Key Bridge piers lacked the level of fender system or island barriers required of newer bridges.[31][32][33] However, engineering experts debate whether such bridge protection systems could have prevented the collapse given Dali's size.[34][35]\n",
    "Collapse\n",
    "Upstream view of the bridge in 2015; Dali hit the fourth pier from left.[36]\n",
    "MV Dali immobilized by the wreckage\n",
    "\n",
    "Dali left the Port of Baltimore at 12:44 a.m. EDT (04:44 UTC) on March 26, 2024,[37] bound for Colombo, Sri Lanka.[38] The ship had two local harbor pilots on board.[36] Following standard operating procedure in Baltimore, tugboats that piloted the ship from its berth were released once the ship was in the channel.[39][40][8] At 1:24 a.m.,[41][42] the ship suffered a \"complete blackout\" and began to drift out of the shipping channel; a backup generator supported electrical systems but did not provide power to the propulsion system.[43] At 1:27 a.m., a mayday call was made from the ship,[42] notifying the Maryland Department of Transportation that the crew had lost propulsion and control of the vessel and that a collision with the bridge was possible.[44]\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the pilots requested that traffic be stopped from crossing the bridge immediately.[45][46][47][48] The ship's lights went out and came on again some moments later; then again went off and returned just before impact as smoke once again began rising from the funnel.[36][49] At the pilot's request, the MDTA Police dispatch asked officers to stop traffic in both directions at 1:27:53 a.m.; outer loop (eastbound/northbound) traffic was stopped at the south side after 20 seconds. Inner loop (westbound/southbound) traffic was stopped at the north side by 1:28:58 a.m., around the time of the collapse.[50] The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) reported that the ship dropped anchor before hitting the bridge, as part of its emergency procedures.[45]\n",
    "\n",
    "At 1:28:45 a.m.,[51][52][53] the ship struck the southwest pier of the central truss arch span, at roughly 8 knots (9.2 mph; 15 km/h).[54] AIS data showed the ship traveling at a speed of 8.7 knots (10.0 mph; 16.1 km/h) at 1:25 a.m. before departing the channel and slowing to 6.8 knots (7.8 mph; 12.6 km/h) by the time of the collision two minutes later.[49][55]\n",
    "\n",
    "Within seconds of the collision, the bridge broke apart in several places,[56] leaving sections protruding from the water and the roadway's approaches cut off.[54] The main span fell onto the ship's bow and a section of it came to rest there.[45][57] The bridge strike and partial collapse were recorded on video.[58][59]\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple vehicles were on the bridge at the time it collapsed, though initially no one was believed to be inside them.[54] Workers were repairing potholes on the bridge[54] and were in their vehicles on a break at the time of the collapse.[60] A resident living near the bridge recalled being awakened by deep rumbling that shook his residence for several seconds following the collapse, which he said \"felt like an earthquake\".[54]\n",
    "\n",
    "Emergency teams began receiving 911 calls at 1:30 a.m.[45] The Baltimore Police Department was alerted to the collapse at 1:35 a.m. Large rescue and recovery efforts were begun.[58] The Coast Guard deployed boats and a helicopter as part of rescue efforts.[45] Fifty public safety divers in eight teams were dispatched to search for people who fell into the river.[61][45]\n",

    "NTSB personnel boarded the ship late on March 26 and obtained the voyage data recorder (VDR), which would help investigators develop a timeline of events leading up to the collision.[93][94] Several possible factors were being considered, including the possibility that contaminated fuel or an improper grade of fuel had caused the loss of the ship's power.[95][96][97] At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on April 10, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy stated that the agency was gathering data about the ship's electrical system and examining its circuit breakers with the assistance of Hyundai Heavy Industries, Dali's shipbuilder.\"\"\"\n",
    "\"\"\"Aftermath\n",
    "\n",
    "The debris from the collapse has blocked maritime access to virtually the entirety of the Port of Baltimore; nearly 30 ships had signaled the port as their destination, and more than 40 were trapped.[106] Only one part of the Port of Baltimore was unaffected: the Tradepoint Atlantic marine terminal at Sparrows Point, on the seaward side of the Key Bridge.[107] Tradepoint Atlantic said on April 3 that it began preparing for an influx of redirected ships and estimated that it would unload and process 10,000 vehicles over the next 15 days.[108]\n",
    "\n",
    "Maryland governor Wes Moore declared a state of emergency shortly thereafter,[45] and Maryland Secretary of Transportation Paul Wiedefeld ordered the suspension of all shipping to and from the Port of Baltimore[109] until further notice; trucking facilities remained operational.[54] At 4:15 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration imposed a 5-nautical-mile (5.8 mi; 9.3 km) temporary flight restriction around the incident site.[110] Maersk, which chartered the vessel,[111] saw the price of its shares decline by about 2% when trading opened at Nasdaq Copenhagen on March 26.[112]\n",

    "Chesapeake 1000 on-site\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is taking the lead in removing the fallen portions of the bridge. The U.S. Navy is planning to remove the submerged portions using barges with heavy-lift cranes, including the \"largest crane ship on the East Coast\": the Chesapeake 1000 of the Donjon Marine Co., able to lift 1,000 short tons (890 long tons; 910 t).[113][114] The designated salvor is Resolve Marine.[69] Thirty-two USACE personnel and 38 Navy contractors were deployed to the scene.[73] More than 1,100 engineering specialists were[needs update] to join them.[115] Seven floating cranes, ten tugboats, nine barges, eight salvage vessels, and five Coast Guard boats were deployed around the bridge.[116]\n",
    "\n",
    "On March 30, engineers began removing the first piece of the bridge from the river.[117][118][119] On April 1, the Coast Guard opened a temporary passage for commercial work vessels involved in recovery and clearing efforts, with a controlling depth of 11 feet (3.4 m), a horizontal clearance of 264 feet (80 m) and a vertical clearance of 96 feet (29 m),[120] and was approving ships' passage case by case.[121] The next day, the first work vessel used the alternate channel: a tugboat pushing a fuel barge to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. A second channel was opened the next day, as work continued on a third channel.[122][123] On April 7, salvage crews started removing containers from Dali.\"\"\",\n",

    "\n",
    "President Joe Biden was briefed on the disaster within hours of the collision.[54] U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg contacted Maryland governor Wes Moore and Baltimore mayor Brandon Scott to offer his department's support.[161] Moore addressed the families of the victims in Spanish, saying, \"Estamos contigo, ahora y siempre [we are with you, now and always]\".[89] Maryland Center for History and Culture vice president David Belew said, \"Our harbor, port and many families are fundamentally changed\" by the disaster.[162] On March 27, Moore and Biden thanked Dali's crew for transmitting the mayday call warning of the ship's power failure and the impending collision.[163][164] On March 28, three officers of the MDTA were recognized at the opening game of the Baltimore Orioles for their role in stopping traffic before the bridge collapsed.[74]\n",
    "President Biden joins Governor Moore and local officials to speak near the bridge\n",
    "\n",
    "Biden visited the site on April 5; he surveyed the wreckage from Marine One and was later briefed by officials from the local government, the Coast Guard and USACE. He pledged the support of the federal government for a bridge replacement and the recovery effort \"every step of the way\", adding that \"the nation has your back\". He also met with families of the victims.[165][166]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mexican embassy in the U.S. is providing consular assistance to the families, with a dedicated phone line for affected Mexican nationals.[167] Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador said the disaster highlighted the contribution of migrants to the US economy and \"demonstrates that migrants go out and do risky jobs at midnight\".[168] Rafael Laveaga Rendón, head of the consular section, travelled to Baltimore to help the workers’ families.[169] It has been confirmed that one of the rescued was from Michoacán, while the two Mexican nationals who are still missing are from Michoacán and Veracruz.\"\"\"\n",
    "\"\"\"Replacement bridge\n",
    "\n",
    "In an address on March 26, Biden said that he would ask Congress to fund a replacement bridge.[170] On March 28, the federal government released an initial $60 million in emergency aid under the Emergency Relief (ER) Program of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) that is subsidized by the Highway Trust Fund.[74][171] Buttigieg also urged Congress to provide funding for a replacement bridge.[172] Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that it was the federal government's responsibility to absorb the costs.[173]\n",
    "\n",
    "The House Freedom Caucus issued a statement listing demands for their support of funding for a replacement bridge, including that the federal government seek maximum liability from the shipping companies upfront.[174][175] While vowing to hold those responsible for the bridge collapse accountable, Maryland Senator Ben Cardin argued against waiting for related litigation to be resolved and insurance claims to be approved, saying \"We're not going to delay opening our channel or rebuilding our bridge with the lengthy process that may take\", with which Buttigieg agreed.[166][176] On April 8, Moore stated that he would meet with members of Congress during the following week to discuss potential support for funding a replacement bridge.[177]\n",
    "\n",
    "While some engineering professors suggested that replacing the bridge could take as long as 10 years and cost at least $350 million,[70][178][179] a report issued by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) noted that replacement bridges can qualify for a Categorical Exclusion (CE) under the National Environmental Policy Act to accelerate regulatory review and project delivery and that the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge that replaced the I-35W Mississippi River bridge (which received a CE) was completed in 11 months, and repairs to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge took five years to complete.[171]\n",
    "\n",
    "The CRS report notes further that a replacement bridge could be eligible for additional funding from the FHWA ER Program that could cover 80% of the project cost since the bridge was a state highway, 90% of the project cost if the expenses cause the state government to exceed its federal-aid highway program funds for the fiscal year, or 100% of the project cost if Congress makes an exception for the project from the ER Program rules (which Congress did for the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge), while any state funds received from an approved insurance claim would offset funding awarded from the ER Program.[171] On April 9, the Maryland congressional delegation announced that they would introduce a bill to make an exception to the ER Program rules for a replacement bridge.\"\"\",\n",
